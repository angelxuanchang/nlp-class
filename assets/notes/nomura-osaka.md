## My Friend Nomura from Osaka <span class="text-muted">by Harold Somers</span>

In Japanese as in many languages, proper names (names of people and places) often have a literal translation
that describes some local feature (e.g. Littlefield, Whitehill, Longridge). Here are some Japanese personal or
place names and their jumbled up literal translations into English.

Your task is to match up the names and the translations. Note that Japanese distinguishes long and short
vowels, but that vowel length distinction is not shown here. Note also that in these examples, `mount` and
`mountain` are different words, as are `field` and `rice-field`.

| English spelling of Japanese names | English |
| 1. Ota | A. Big slope |
| 2. Nakayama | B. Tree river |
| 3. Kigawa | C. Slope of the mountain |
| 4. Kazan | D. Field village |
| 5. Murakami | E. Above the village |
| 6. Kagawa | F. Above the river |
| 7. Ono | G. Middle of the rice-field |
| 8. Nomura | H. Little field |
| 9. Tanaka | I. Middle mountain |
| 10. Sakuragi | J. Original rice-field |
| 11. Nihon | K. Cherry tree |
| 12. Osaka | L. Fire mount (= volcano) |
| 13. Yamazaka | M. Big rice-field |
| 14. Kawakami | N. Fire river |
| 15. Honda | O. Origin of the sun (= Japan) |
