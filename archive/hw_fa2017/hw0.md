Homework & Leaderboard setup
=============================================================

<span class="text-info">Start by {{ site.hwdates[0].startdate }} or earlier</span> |
<span class="text-warning">Due on {{ site.hwdates[0].deadline }}</span>

For this course, we use [an automated homework submission
system](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com) built on [Google App
Engine](https://appengine.google.com). One component of this system
is the [leaderboard](leaderboard.html), which introduces a competitive
element into the assignments with realtime display of group submissions
according to their scores on assignment metrics.

You should follow the steps in this document to make sure that
everything is working for you.

0. Join a group. The maximum group size is four. Decide on a group
name. Make it memorable. Register yourself as a group on
[Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}).

1. Visit the course submission page at
[sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com). At
least one person in your group will need a valid Google account.

2. This system is used to upload all homework assignments. You
should use your group name as the handle when you submit your
assignment. By default the leaderboard will use your Google nickname
which cannot be used to assign your group a grade.

3. Homework 0 (this one) has been activated. Use the file submission
dialog to upload your submissions. Check your status on the [leaderboard](leaderboard.html)

4. Upload a tar.gz or zip file as the HW0 submission on
[Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}).  In
future assignments you will be uploading your source code and
documentation as your submission.

## Homework 0

Homework 0 expects a file containing a single number. The leaderboard
displays a simple nonmonotonic function of this number, and sorts
the entries according to the highest value. 

To get full marks, you must do the following:

* _Upload_ your file on [the upload
page](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com/). 
Only one person per group should submit for the group.

* You must use a valid group name that is verifiable on
[Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}) 

* Your group must upload your file as a tar.gz or zip file as the HW0
submission on [Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}). Only one person
per group needs to submit here as well.

In future homeworks, you will submit your output files to the [upload
page on Google](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com) and submit your
source code to the submission page on [Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}).
