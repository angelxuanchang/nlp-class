Final Project
-------------

<span class="text-info">Start by {{ site.hwdates[5].startdate }} or earlier</span> |
<span class="text-warning">Due on {{ site.hwdates[5].deadline }}</span>

There will be a poster session in downtown Vancouver on {{
site.hwdates[5].deadline }}. Your group must present a poster at
this poster session providing details about your final course
project.

If you are enrolled in the Machine Learning course you must present
a different poster. You can share code between the projects but the
projects must be different from each other and have a distinct
contribution.
